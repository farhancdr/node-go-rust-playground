# Node / Go / Rust Playground Monorepo

This monorepo contains simple playgrounds for TypeScript/Node.js, Go, and Rust. Each playground is independent and runs a basic `main` file.

## Structure
- `node/`: Node.js playground
- `go/`: Go playground
- `rust/`: Rust playground

## Getting Started
1. Ensure prerequisites are installed (Node.js, Go, Rust).
2. Follow the setup instructions in each playground's `README.md`.

## Running Playgrounds
- TypeScript: `cd node && bun install && bun start`
- Go: `cd go && go run main.go`
- Rust: `cd rust && cargo run`
